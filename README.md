# Upstairs/Downstairs Replacer - Chrome Extension 

A chrome extension that replaces the words up 'upstairs' and 'downstairs' with 'outstairs' and 'instairs' respectively. 

## Motivation

Inspired by the intro to [this article](https://placesjournal.org/article/the-shape-of-space/) in Places Journal. 

> > "Buckminster Fuller had an unusual way of talking about stairs. Instead of downstairs and upstairs, he encouraged people to say instairs and outstairs. “They all laugh about it,” he wrote, “But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real reality.” 3 Writing in 1970, at the dawn of extra-planetary space travel, Fuller identified a break in humans’ spatial perception. Standing on Earth, we see the ground plane as flat, but we know the planet is a sphere. To describe motion and existence in a vast universe, where planetary surfaces are the exception, we would need a new language."
